# CSS File Structure

This directory contains the refactored CSS files for the Space Shooter game, organized for optimal loading performance.

## File Structure

### 1. `critical.css`

**Load Priority: IMMEDIATE**

- Essential styles for first paint
- Base styles (\*, html, body)
- Main menu layout and styling
- Button styles
- Hidden class utilities
- Game canvas basic styles

**Size: ~7KB**
**Purpose: Prevent FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content) and ensure fast initial render**

### 2. `backgrounds.css`

**Load Priority: AFTER DOM READY**

- Starfield background styles
- Nebula background effects
- Visual enhancement styles

**Size: ~2KB**
**Purpose: Visual effects that don't block initial interaction**

### 3. `panels.css`

**Load Priority: AFTER DOM READY**

- Settings panel styles
- Leaderboard panel styles
- Form controls styling
- Panel animations and interactions

**Size: ~8KB**
**Purpose: Secondary UI components loaded when needed**

### 4. `responsive.css`

**Load Priority: AFTER DOM READY**

- Media queries for mobile/tablet
- Performance optimizations for low-end devices
- Responsive design adjustments

**Size: ~3KB**
**Purpose: Progressive enhancement for different screen sizes**

## Loading Strategy

1. **Critical CSS** is loaded in the `<head>` to prevent render blocking
2. **Non-critical CSS** files are loaded progressively after DOMContentLoaded
3. **Total CSS size reduced** from one large file to smaller, focused files
4. **Better caching** - only critical styles need to be re-downloaded on changes

## Performance Benefits

- **Faster Time to First Paint (TTFP)**
- **Reduced render blocking**
- **Better caching strategy**
- **Improved mobile performance**
- **Progressive enhancement**
